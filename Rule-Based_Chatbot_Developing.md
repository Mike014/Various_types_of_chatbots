# Main Steps in Developing a Rule-Based Chatbot

## Package Installation

Install the necessary libraries, such as NLTK and other Python dependencies.

## Creating the Corpus

Build a data corpus containing common words, phrases, or questions with corresponding answers. This step defines the foundation on which the chatbot will work.

## Text Preprocessing

Clean and normalize the text to remove noise, stopwords, and other unnecessary information. Develop helper functions to facilitate data handling.

## Generating Responses

Use methods to match questions with predefined answers. Implement techniques like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to calculate word relevance.

## Training and Testing the Chatbot

Evaluate the chatbot's performance by testing it with various inputs. Make improvements based on the results.
